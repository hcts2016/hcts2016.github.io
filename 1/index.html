               <br>
               <b><i>Hello Key Clubbers!</i></b>
               <p>My name is Devin Sun, and I am from the New Jersey District of Key Club International. This past service year, I had the pleasure of serving as a Lieutenant Governor. From the experiences that I gained as an International Trustee, I knew that I had more to give to the wonderful organization that is Key Club International.</p>
               <br>
               <b><i>AS A KEY CLUBBER</i></b>
               <p>I was introduced to Key Club at a young age. My older brother was in high school while I was in middle school. He would always come home speaking about some club called <i>Key Club</i> that he was involved in. I did not think much of it, since he was always involved in so many different activities. One day, however, I remember being told by my mother that we were invited as guests to a District Convention. At that time, I, of course, had no idea what a District Convention was. As I arrived, I saw hundreds of high school students, sitting in one enormous ballroom, all carefully watching a girl speaking at a podium. As my mother and I took our seats, I watched in awe, at the spectacle that is Key Club. I saw the passion for service in each Key Clubber. I saw the kindness in each Key Clubber. And, ultimately, I saw a will to change the world for the better. It was at that precise moment, that I knew that I wanted to become a Key Clubber.</p>
               <br>
               <b><i>AS A HIGH SCHOOLER</i></b>
               <p>Like you all, I'm just like any other normal student. I have homework, I like to hang out with friends, and I have hobbies outside of school. As for extracurriculars aside from Key Club, I am in my school's Forensics Speech & Debate Team, FBLA, and French Honor Society. Some of my hobbies include longboarding, fishing, and fencing.  My favorite subject in school would either be math or science.</p>
