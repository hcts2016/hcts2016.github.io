                <p>My name is Devin Sun, and I am from the New Jersey District of Key Club International. This past service year, I had the pleasure of serving as an International Trustee. From the experiences that I gained as an International Trustee, I knew that I had more to give to the wonderful organization that is Key Club International.</p>

                <b><i>AS A KEY CLUBBER</i></b>

                <p>I was introduced to Key Club at a young age. My older brother was in high school while I was in middle school. He would always come home speaking about some club called <i>Key Club</i> that he was involved in. I did not think much of it, since he was always involved in so many different activities. One day, however, I remember being told by my mother that we were invited as guests to a District Convention. At that time, I, of course, had no idea what a District Convention was. As I arrived, I saw hundreds of high school students, sitting in one enormous ballroom, all carefully watching a girl speaking at a podium. As my mother and I took our seats, I watched in awe, at the spectacle that is Key Club. I saw the passion for service in each Key Clubber. I saw the kindness in each Key Clubber. And, ultimately, I saw a will to change the world for the better. It was at that precise moment, that I knew that I wanted to become a Key Clubber.</p>

                <b><i>AS A HIGH SCHOOLER</i></b>

                <p>Like you all, I'm just like any other normal student. I have homework, I like to hang out with friends, and I have hobbies outside of school. As for extracurriculars aside from Key Club, I am in my school's Forensics Speech & Debate Team, FBLA, and French Honor Society. Some of my hobbies include longboarding, fishing, and fencing, graphic design and videography.  My favorite subject in school would either be math or science.</p>
